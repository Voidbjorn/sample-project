## assumption

The movie ratings should be on a scale from 1-5.

I assume there is an error in the data, and that the postman got an 5 in sound because 6 is not posible

## New data

title,sound,acting,effects,music
Titanic,4,5,4,3
The Godfather,5,5,5,4
Toy Story 2,4,4,3,1
The postman,5,5,5,5

## ordinal data
